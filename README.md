### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# I'm Grenish Rai

I am a full-stack web developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition to my foundational knowledge of these web technologies, I also have experience using libraries such as ReactJS and beginner-level experience with ThreeJS. I have hands-on experience using design tools like Figma and Framer, as well as frameworks such as TailwindCSS and Bootstrap. While I have only basic knowledge of programming languages like Python and C, I am dedicated to continually expanding my skill set. I have a preference for MongoDB over mySQL and I am currently in the process of learning more about it. While I have limited experience in 3D modeling using Blender, I am eager to develop my skills in this area.

As a student, I am dedicated to learning and mastering new technologies to excel in my career as a full-stack web developer. I enjoy working collaboratively with others and am always eager to take on new challenges and opportunities to grow and improve.

And It's my portfolio showcasing all my works on web development so far, created using ReactJs, ThreeJs, TailwindCSS.
